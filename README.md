Homepage for MAAL: Multimodality-Aware Autoencoder-based Affordance Learning for 3D Articulated Objects

This repository is for the code and real-world experiments of MAAL.

I am in discussion with the school's robotic laboratory about borrowing a robotic arm. If the experiment can be completed, I will upload the results as soon as possible.
